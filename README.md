# airline-data-segmentation

In this project I apply a two-level marketing segmentation model on the customers of an airline who participated in a survey. Attitudinal and demographic attributes of these customers was used to create a segmentation model in R.

Table of contents:

1- k-means on attitudinal variables (Level-1 Segmentation)
2- Predictive model for Level-1
3- Using the demographic variables to predict Level-1 segments (Level-2 segmentation)
4- Interpreting the demographic data in each segment (Level-2 segmentation)
5- Implementing a marketing strategy based on Level-1 and Level-2

Again, the report is in the [html](./assign4.html) file. All supporting files are attached too for you to run the code in R yourselves.
