# airline-data-segmentation

In this project I apply a two-level marketing segmentation model on the customers of an airline who participated in a survey. Attitudinal and demographic attributes of these customers was used to create a segmentation model in R.

Again, the report is in the [html](./assign4.html) file. All supporting files are attached too for you to run the code in R yourselves.
